## 📊 **Message Analysis**

### 🔵 **DPI Warning (NORMAL - No Action Needed)**
```
qt.qpa.window: SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext() failed: The operation completed successfully.
Qt's default DPI awareness context is DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2.
```

**What it means:**
- ✅ **Normal Windows behavior** - Qt informing about DPI settings
- ✅ **No impact on functionality** - App works perfectly
- ✅ **Common on Windows 10/11** - Standard Qt message
- ✅ **Can be ignored** - No action required

**Why it happens:**
- Windows has different DPI awareness modes
- Qt is just informing which mode it's using
- The "failed" message is misleading - it actually succeeded

---

### 🟡 **Layout Warning (FIXED)**
```
QLayout::addChildLayout: layout QHBoxLayout "" already has a parent
```

**What it was:**
- ⚠️ **Minor layout issue** - Layout being added to multiple parents
- ⚠️ **Could cause UI positioning problems**
- ⚠️ **Not a crash, but should be fixed**

**How it was fixed:**
- Removed duplicate `video_layout.addLayout(video_row)` call
- Ensured each layout has only one parent
- Cleaned up layout hierarchy

## 🔧 **Next Steps (Optional)**

If you want to suppress the DPI warning, you can create a `qt.conf` file in your app directory:
```
[Platforms]
WindowsArguments = dpiawareness=0
```

But this is purely cosmetic - your app works great as-is!
