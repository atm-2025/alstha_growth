## üß† AI Models

### DistilBERT
- **Purpose**: Sentence similarity and command matching
- **Model**: `distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens`
- **Function**: Converts natural language to command embeddings
- **Performance**: Fast inference with high accuracy

### Microsoft Phi-2
- **Purpose**: Advanced natural language understanding
- **Model**: `microsoft/phi-2`
- **Function**: Context analysis and command interpretation
- **Performance**: State-of-the-art language model

### Model Configuration
Models are configured in `modules/json/jarvis_config.json`:
```json
{
  "ai_models": {
    "sentence_transformer": "distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens",
    "language_model": "microsoft/phi-2",
    "confidence_threshold": 0.6
  }
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Voice Recognition Not Working**:
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Ensure PyAudio is installed correctly
   - Test microphone in Windows settings

2. **AI Models Not Loading**:
   - Check internet connection for model download
   - Ensure sufficient disk space (models are ~2GB)
   - Verify torch and transformers installation

3. **Commands Not Executing**:
   - Check Windows permissions
   - Ensure applications exist on system
   - Verify command syntax

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Close other applications to free memory
   - Use SSD for faster model loading
   - Consider using CPU-only models for lower memory usage

### Error Messages

- **"Audio libraries not available"**: Install speechrecognition and pyttsx3
- **"AI libraries not available"**: Install torch, transformers, sentence-transformers
- **"Voice recognition error"**: Check microphone and internet connection
- **"Model download failed"**: Check internet connection and disk space

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Custom Commands
Add custom commands by modifying the `AICommandProcessor` class:

self.commands["custom"] = [
    "your custom command",
    "another custom command"
]
```

### Model Customization
- **Fine-tune models** on your specific command set
- **Add domain-specific vocabulary** for better recognition
- **Custom confidence thresholds** for different command types
